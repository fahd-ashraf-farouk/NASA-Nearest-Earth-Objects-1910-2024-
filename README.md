# NASA-Nearest-Earth-Objects-1910-2024-classification
NASA | Nearest Earth Objects (1910-2024)

Project Description :
NASA-Nearest-Earth-Objects-1910-2024-classification is the machine_learning project designed to analyze and predict "Nearest Earth Objects". Some such bodies really pose a danger to the planet Earth, will be classified as "is_hazardous".

features : 

. Data analysis using ML techgniques 
2- Accurate predictions based on data 

Requirements: 
1- jupyter Notebook
2- Python_Libraries(Pandas-matplotlib-numpy-scikit-learn)

How to use the project: 
1- Download the Python_librarys by bach (pip install lib_name)
1- Download the dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivansher/nasa-nearest-earth-objects-1910-2024/data)
2- Read the dataset 
3- Run the codes

Porocces : 1- Informations about our dataset
2- Data cleaning
3- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4- Data preprossing
5- ML models(LogisticRegression-DecisionTreeClassifier-KNeighborsClassifier-RandomForestClassifier) implementation and evaluation(classification_report -accuracy_score)
6- comparison betwen the real outputs and Predictions by the models (plots and numbers)


Findigs: when exploring the dataset i found that the labels was imbalanced so i addresed this by the ML modls via class_weight prameter that make some models accurate well and some wasn't good
