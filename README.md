# NASA Nearest Earth Objects Classification

# Project Description
This machine learning project analyzes and predicts Nearest Earth Objects (NEOs) using data from NASA. The goal is to classify NEOs as hazardous or non-hazardous.

# Features
1. Data analysis using machine learning techniques
2. Accurate predictions based on data

# Requirements
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn

# Getting Started
1. Install required Python libraries using pip: pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
2. Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivansher/nasa-nearest-earth-objects-1910-2024/data
3. Read the dataset and run the code

# Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Implementation and evaluation of machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier)
4. Comparison of real outputs and predictions by the models (plots and numbers)

# Findings
During data exploration, I found that the labels were imbalanced. To address this, I used the class weight parameter in the machine learning models, which resulted in some models performing well and others not.
